When you place your line correctly, you'll see a small alert telling you you've hit the hotspot.\\n\\nAfter enough fish are caught at a hotspot it will become depleted. You can tell a hotspot is depleted when there are no fish jumping.\\n\u0026lt;img src=\"lyshineui/images/tooltipimages/fishinghotspotdepleted.png\" height=\"188\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/img\u0026gt;\\nA depleted hotspot will become active again after some time has passed.\\n\\nAs your fishing skill improves, you will be able to find more and better hotspots.",
